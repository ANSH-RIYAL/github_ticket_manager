## Details: Shadow Knowledge, Diff Trees, and Structured Prompts

### Roles
- **Navigator**: serves directory-scoped contexts from the Shadow Knowledge Tree (SKT) and Shadow Diff Environment (SDE).
- **Orchestrator**: coordinates deterministic guards and LLM calls; aggregates per-directory results.
- **PR Agent**: evaluates ticket alignment and impact using directory-scoped prompts.

### Shadow Artifacts
- `_dir.meta.json` (per directory):
  - `dir_name`, `rel_path`, `parent_meta`, `children[]`, `files[]`
  - `links.api_exports`, `links.deps_subgraph`
- `api_exports.json` (per directory): exports within subtree
- `deps_subgraph.json` (per directory): nodes/edges within or touching subtree
- `_dir.diff.json` (per directory during analysis): changed files with hunks, local `no_change` listings, children links
- `_index.json` at roots (knowledge and diff trees)

### Canonical Diff
- `git diff --unified=3 --no-color --find-renames --find-copies --output-indicator-new=+ --output-indicator-old=-`
- Parsed once â†’ partitioned into per-directory `_dir.diff.json` with capped hunk text

### Structured Prompting (LLM)
All prompts are instruction-locked and JSON-only. No subjective free text; optional `notes`/`comments` keys are allowed but not required.

1) Ticket alignment (per directory)
System:
```
ONLY_OUTPUT {"schema_version":"1.0","ticket_alignment":{"matched":[],"unmet":[],"evidence":[]}}. Use dir_context.meta/files, dir_context.diff hunks, api_exports, deps_subgraph. If evidence is absent in this subtree, leave unmet unless proven by global_summary.
```
User input:
```json
{ "schema_version": "1.0", "ticket": { ... }, "dir_context": { ... }, "global_summary": { ... } }
```

2) Impact (per directory)
System:
```
ONLY_OUTPUT {"changed_exports":[],"signature_changes":[],"possibly_impacted":[]}. Use dir_context.diff + api_exports + deps_subgraph. Limit to this subtree.
```
User input:
```json
{ "schema_version": "1.0", "dir_context": { ... }, "feature_summary": { ... }, "dry_run": { ... } }
```

3) Global alignment (root; existing)
System and schema unchanged, but can be fed with root dir_context for consistency.

### Logging and Budgets
- All prompts logged to `prompt_performance/`.
- Navigator caps hunks and lists per directory by `budget` and internal limits; reproducible and small.
